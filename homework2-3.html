                    <h2>Puppy</h2>
                    <p>A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh
                         1~1.5 kg (2.2~3.3 lb), while larger ones can weigh up to 7~11 kg (15~24 lb).
                          All puppies display primary altriciality and healthy puppies grow quickly after birth.
                           A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier.
                            Puppy refers specifically to young dogs, while pup may be used for other animals such as wolves,
                             seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks.</p>

                    <h2>Cat</h2>
                    <p>The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house cat,
                         is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. Recent advances in archaeology and genetics
                          have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. 
                          It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact.
                           It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its retractable claws, 
                           it is adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth,
                            and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.
                             Cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body language.
                              It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals.
                               It also secretes and perceives pheromones.</p>
