                    <p>A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh
                         1~1.5 kg (2.2~3.3 lb), while larger ones can weigh up to 7~11 kg (15~24 lb).
                          All puppies display primary altriciality and healthy puppies grow quickly after birth.
                           A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier.
                            Puppy refers specifically to young dogs, while pup may be used for other animals such as wolves,
                             seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks.</p>
