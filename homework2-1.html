        <p style="font-size:50px;">Japan to Launch Wooden Satellite This Year</p>
        Japanese scientists have created a satellite made of wood, which will be launched into space as early as this summer.

<br>
<br>
        Called LignoSat, the box-shaped satellite is small enough to be held in your hand, but inside it are experiments that will show how well a wooden device can work in space.

<br>
<br>
        LignoSat is the result of a project by Kyoto University and the Sumitomo Forestry company to find new materials for satellites that will be better for our planet.

<br>
<br>
        Until now, all satellites have been made of metal. When they reenter Earth's atmosphere, they burn up, leaving tiny particles of aluminum that could be very bad for our environment, and may even damage the ozone layer.

<br>
<br>
        A wooden satellite, however, would burn up into ash, which is far less harmful.

<br>
<br>
        Researchers from Kyoto University tested different kinds of wood first in laboratories, and then sending three samples to the International Space Station, where they were tested in the vacuum of space for nearly a year.

<br>
<br>
        The scientists found that the wood was not damaged by being left in space, which the leader of the project, Koji Murata, said was probably because there is no oxygen in space for wood to burn in, and no living creatures that might cause it to rot.

<br>
<br>
        Different types of wood were tested, and LignoSat has been made of magnolia wood, which was found to be the strongest.

<br>
<br>
        The launch date for LignoSat has not yet been decided, but it should go up on a US rocket either this summer or a little later in the year. The satellite will then spend six months in space before reentering the Earth's atmosphere.

<br>
<br>
        If LignoSat works well in space and the project is a success, then wood could be used to make more satellites in the future.
